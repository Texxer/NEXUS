================================================================================
                    GIT IGNORE ENFORCEMENT POLICY
================================================================================

CRITICAL: The following directories must NEVER be pushed to Git

EXCLUDED DIRECTORIES
====================

frameworks/          - IDE frameworks analysis (vim, neovim, vscode, etc.)
                      Size: ~1GB+ (too large for repository)
                      These are local analysis files only

NEXUS/               - Old NEXUS directory structure
                      Use /core instead for active development

models/              - Ollama model files (local only)

ollama/              - Ollama runtime files (local only)

backup/              - Local backup directory

Also excluded (in .gitignore):
target/              - Build artifacts
node_modules/        - Node dependencies
venv/                - Python virtual environments
.vscode/             - VS Code settings
.env                 - Environment files with secrets


VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
======================

✓ Is frameworks/ in .gitignore?
  Answer: YES - it's listed

✓ Are there any tracked files in frameworks/?
  Run: git ls-files frameworks/
  Expected output: (empty - no output means nothing is tracked)

✓ Before pushing:
  Run: git status
  Expected: "nothing to commit, working tree clean"


ENFORCEMENT RULES
=================

1. NEVER manually add anything from frameworks/:
   DON'T do: git add frameworks/*
   DON'T do: git add -A frameworks/

2. If accidentally added, remove from index:
   git rm -r --cached frameworks/

3. Always verify before pushing:
   git ls-files frameworks/
   (Should return nothing)

4. If needing to update frameworks locally:
   - Make changes directly to /frameworks
   - Verify git status shows it as "Untracked"
   - NEVER commit or push


HISTORY
=======

All framework source code was previously removed from Git history:
- Commit: "fix: Re-gitignore frameworks/ folder and untrack from cache"
- Action: Cleaned up entire frameworks/ folder from repository
- Result: Reduced repository size significantly


CURRENT STATUS
==============

✓ frameworks/ is in .gitignore
✓ frameworks/ is NOT in git index
✓ No framework files will be pushed
✓ Safe to work with framework files locally
