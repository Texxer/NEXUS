# 🎯 Quick Start - NEXUS Pro MVP

## 📋 What Was Just Created

✅ **Git Repository** - Initialized with first commit  
✅ **Tauri Project** - Full-stack Rust + Svelte scaffold  
✅ **Backend Code** - 390 LOC of Rust stubs (editor, LSP, Ollama)  
✅ **Frontend Code** - 190 LOC of Svelte components (UI layout)  
✅ **Build Pipeline** - Cargo + Vite configured  

---

## 🚀 To Start Development

### Step 1: Install Frontend Dependencies (First Time Only)

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Michael\OneDrive\generalAI\IDE\ui
npm install
```

### Step 2: Terminal 1 - Start Frontend Dev Server

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Michael\OneDrive\generalAI\IDE\ui
npm run dev
```

✅ Watch for: `Local: http://localhost:5173`

### Step 3: Terminal 2 - Start Backend Dev App

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Michael\OneDrive\generalAI\IDE
cargo tauri dev
```

✅ Watch for: Desktop window opens with dark UI

### Terminal 3: Make Changes

Edit files in `src-tauri/src/` or `ui/src/` - both auto-reload!
