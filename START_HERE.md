## 💡 Three Strategic Documents Drive Everything

### Document 1: Technical Roadmap (012)
- What to build
- How to build it
- Performance targets
- Success criteria

→ **Hand this to engineers**

### Document 2: Business Strategy (013)
- Who to sell to
- How to position it
- Market opportunity ($500M-$700M SAM)
- Go-to-market plan

→ **Hand this to marketing**

### Document 3: Integration Framework (014)
- How development and marketing coordinate
- Weekly sync structure
- 30-day roadmap
- Decision matrix

→ **Use this to lead the team**

---

## ⚡ Performance Targets

**Why These Matter:**
- Every IDE competitor is slow or bloated
- We win by being FAST + BEAUTIFUL + FREE + AI-NATIVE

| Target | Why | Impact |
|--------|-----|--------|
| **50ms startup** | Vim speed, VS Code UI | No competitors achieve this |
| **<50MB RAM** | Remote devs, slow laptops | Works on old machines |
| **<10MB download** | 3G networks, emerging markets | 20x smaller than VS Code |

---

## 🎓 The Competitive Advantage

### What Competitors Do
- VS Code: 500ms startup, 200MB RAM, 150MB download
- IntelliJ: 8-10s startup, 2GB RAM, 500MB download
- Vim: 50ms startup, but CLI only (no GUI)

### What NEXUS Does
- **50ms startup** like Vim but with beautiful GUI
- **<50MB RAM** lightweight like cloud editors
- **<10MB download** smallest IDE ever
- **AI-native** not cloud-dependent
- **Free & open source** no $594/year tax
