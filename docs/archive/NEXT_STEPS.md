# 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS - Do This Now

**Exact action plan for the next 48 hours**

---

## ⏰ RIGHT NOW (Next 30 minutes)

### 1. Decide Your Path (5 min)

Read: `docs/001_START_HERE.md`

**Question**: Do you want:

**A) Full-Featured IDE** (3-4 weeks)
- Like VS Code
- All features
- LSP, plugins, terminal, debugger

**B) Ultra-Fast Pro Version** (1-2 weeks) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
- Like Sublime + Ollama
- 10MB executable
- <100ms startup
- Essential features only

**→ Pro Version is objectively better. Here's why:**
- Ships 2 weeks faster
- 10x smaller
- 2x faster startup
- Easier to maintain
- You can add features later
- Same AI power

### 2. Confirm Stack Choice (5 min)

**Pro Version uses**:
- Backend: Rust (same as now! ✅)
- Frontend: Svelte (instead of React - 3x smaller)
- Desktop: Tauri (instead of Electron - 5x lighter)

**Not switching languages!** Just optimizing.

### 3. Quick Reality Check (10 min)

Do you have these installed?

```powershell
# Check Rust
rustc --version

# Check Node.js
node --version

# If missing, install:
winget install -e --id Rustlang.Rust.MSVC
winget install -e --id OpenJS.NodeJS
```

---

## 📅 TODAY - After 2 PM

### Read Roadmap (20 min)

Read: `docs/003_PRO_VERSION.md`

**Sections to read:**
1. Week 1: Core Build (what you'll do Days 1-7)
2. Code examples (show what you're building)
3. Comparison (why this is better)

---

## 🌙 TONIGHT - Before bed

### Setup Git Commit (5 min)

Mark this milestone:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Michael\OneDrive\generalAI"

git add -A

git commit -m "📝 Doc consolidation: 31 files → 6 essential + Pro Version roadmap"

git push
```

---

## 🌅 TOMORROW MORNING

### Ready to Code (30 min prep)

**Step 1: Create Svelte + Tauri project**

```powershell
# Install Tauri CLI
cargo install tauri-cli

# Create project
cargo tauri init

# Follow prompts
```

**Step 2: Install dependencies**

```powershell
cd ui
npm install
npm install highlight.js
```

**Step 3: First build test**

```powershell
cargo tauri dev
```

**Expected**: Blank window appears

---

## 📋 DECISION MATRIX

**Choose Pro Version IF:**
- ✅ You want to ship FAST
- ✅ You like focused products
- ✅ You can always add features later
- ✅ You want 10MB download
- ✅ You want <100ms launch

**Choose Standard IDE IF:**
- ✅ You need all features now
- ✅ You have 3-4 weeks
- ✅ You want LSP/plugins/terminal
- ✅ You don't mind 150MB download

---

## 🔥 MOST LIKELY SCENARIO

**You'll choose Pro Version because:**

1. **Time**: Ships in 2 weeks vs 4
2. **Market**: "Fastest editor" beats "full featured"
3. **Quality**: Less code = better polish
4. **Momentum**: Working product in 2 weeks > unfinished in 4
5. **Feedback**: Real users, real feedback, iterate

## 💬 FAQ: Should I really do Pro Version?

**Q: Won't I be missing features?**
A: No. You're keeping the 90% you need. The 10% you can add later.

**Q: What if users want plugins?**
A: You can add plugin support in v2. Prove the core works first.

**Q: Isn't Svelte less popular than React?**
A: Yes, but Svelte is:
- 3x faster
- Simpler to learn
- Compiles to smaller JS
- Perfect for your use case

**Q: Why not stay with current stack?**
A: You can! Pro Version just optimizes it. You could do full IDE too.

**Q: How long does Day 1 really take?**
A: 3-4 hours if you've built Tauri apps before  
8 hours if new to Tauri  
This is normal, not a blocker.
