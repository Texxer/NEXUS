## 🚀 Recommended Path: PRO VERSION

**Why?** Launches 2x faster, ships in 1-2 weeks, still has AI power

```
Week 1: Build core
├─ Day 1-2: Svelte + Tauri setup
├─ Day 3-4: Editor with highlighting
├─ Day 5-6: File operations
├─ Day 7: AI completions

Week 2: Launch
├─ Day 8-10: Optimize & profile
├─ Day 11-13: Features & polish
└─ Day 14: Ship it! 🚀
```

**Deliverable**: 10MB executable, <100ms startup

## 🛠️ Tech Comparison

### React vs Svelte
```
React Bundle:  30MB (tons of overhead)
Svelte Bundle: 2MB  (3x smaller!)

React Runtime: Complex virtual DOM
Svelte:        Compile-time framework

React:         More popular
Svelte:        Better for performance
```

### Electron vs Tauri
```
Electron: 150MB (full Chromium embedded)
Tauri:    10MB  (just webview wrapper)

Electron: 600ms startup
Tauri:    <100ms startup

Tauri:    More efficient
Tauri:    Growing adoption
```
